      "1. **Individuals entering the criminal justice system should not be subject to forced opioid withdrawal nor forced to transition from agonist (methadone or buprenorphine) to antagonist (naltrexone) treatment.** If opioid withdrawal does occur, the patient should be provided withdrawal management services.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Patients being treated for opioid use disorder at the time of entrance into the criminal justice system should continue their treatment.** Criminal justice staff should coordinate care and access to pharmacotherapy to avoid interruption in treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Pharmacotherapy and psychosocial treatment:** Individuals in the criminal justice system who have opioid use disorder or who are experiencing opioid withdrawal should be offered a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial treatment (based on an assessment of their individual psychosocial needs).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Continuation of treatment after release:** Patients being treated for opioid use disorder while in prison or jail should be stabilized on pharmacotherapy (methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone) and continue in treatment after their release. Patient care on reentry to the community should be individualized and coordinated with treatment providers in the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Naloxone kits:** Naloxone kits should be available within correctional facilities.\n",

      "Generated Answer: I cannot find an answer to that question in the provided documents. The documents outline general dosing guidelines for methadone but do not specify a \"best dose\" for any individual patient. Methadone dosing should be individualized based on the patient's response, clinical assessment, and specific circumstances. For specific dosing recommendations tailored to your patient, it is recommended to consult the relevant clinical guidelines or a healthcare professional who can consider the patient's unique medical history and needs.\n",

      "\n",
      "--- Testing Query: How do I treat opioid withdrawal symptoms? ---\n",
      "Generated Answer: To treat opioid withdrawal symptoms, the ASAM National Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder recommends several strategies:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Gradually tapering doses of opioid agonists**: Methadone or buprenorphine are typically used for this purpose. Methadone and buprenorphine are generally more effective in reducing withdrawal symptoms, retaining patients in withdrawal management, and supporting the completion of withdrawal management. For patients withdrawing from short-acting opioids, the initial dose of methadone should typically be 20-30 mg per day, and the patient may be tapered off in approximately 6-10 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists**: FDA-approved lofexidine and off-label clonidine are safe and effective for managing opioid withdrawal. However, methadone and buprenorphine are more effective in reducing withdrawal symptoms, retaining patients in withdrawal management, and supporting the completion of withdrawal management.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Buprenorphine**: It should not be initiated until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal. Once signs of withdrawal are confirmed, a dose of buprenorphine sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms is given (an initial dose of 2-4 mg titrated up as needed).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Opioid withdrawal management on its own is not a treatment method for opioid use disorder**. It is important to advise patients about the risk of relapse and other safety concerns, including increased risk of overdose and overdose death. Ongoing maintenance medication, in combination with psychosocial treatment appropriate for the patient’s needs, is the standard of care for treating opioid use disorder.\n",
