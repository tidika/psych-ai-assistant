SOPs ensure consistency in how employees handle PHI, reducing human errors that could lead to violations. Well-documented procedures also serve as a reference for audits and compliance reviews. ## Steps to develop an effective HIPAA compliant communication SOP ### Identify communication channels First, assess all communication methods used within the organization. According to the University of Southern California\\'s School of Communication and Journalism, effectively communicating goes beyond enhancing the dynamic between the patient and provider, it can be a tool that transforms the quality of care, which can ultimately improve patient outcomes.\" This emphasizes the importance of effective communication in healthcare.', 'An SOP (standard operating procedure) is a set of documented guidelines that outline how an organization should handle protected health information (PHI) to ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations. #### Why is it important to use HIPAA compliant communication tools? HIPAA compliant tools provide encryption, access controls, and security measures to protect PHI from unauthorized access, breaches, and cyber threats. #### How often should HIPAA communication SOPs be updated? SOPs should be reviewed and updated regularly, at least annually, or whenever there are changes in HIPAA regulations, new communication technologies, or identified security risks.

It is important to know that everyone responds to medications differently. If one medicine does not work, the doctor     may suggest trying another one. It is also important to understand that treating agitation or psychosis with medications     involves coordination among care providers, including pharmacists. This helps prevent harmful drug interactions or     impacting on other chronic conditions.     WHAT TO DO WHEN USING AN ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATION     Ask the Doctor about Starting at a Low Dose For older people with dementia, a common starting dose is one-third to one-half the dose that is used with a younger     adult, or the smallest tablet available. Doses should be increased slowly to the lowest amount that relieves symptoms.     Work with the Doctor to Monitor Response and Side Effects Talk to the doctor regularly to see if symptoms have improved and if there are any side effects. It may be helpful to     write down and share information with the doctor about any responses or side effects to the prescribed medication, or     changes in other medications or medical conditions.. If there are side effects, discuss with the doctor whether to continue     the medication, decrease the amount, or stop taking it.', 'More     information and tips for managing the symptoms of dementia are included under the Additional Resources section.     Caregivers can learn to understand these symptoms better and improve communication skills with the person living with     dementia. By learning how to care for and cope with the symptoms of agitation and psychosis, families can reduce their     sense of burden and improve their own well-being.     Patient and Caregiver Guide3     Patient and Caregiver Guide     Consider Antipsychotic Medications Medication options to treat agitation or psychosis may involve using antipsychotics. Common antipsychotic medications     include risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine, and haloperidol. The decision to use these medications should be     made carefully and in consultation with a doctor. Antipsychotic medications should only be used in cases of emergency     or when agitation or symptoms of psychosis are severe, dangerous, or cause significant distress.     How effective antipsychotic medications are may vary depending on things such as the type of dementia, severity of     symptoms, and other unique situations. On average, the benefit of antipsychotic medications in clinical studies is small.     For some individuals, they may reduce distress, make it easier for caregivers to provide care, and improve safety and     quality of life.', 'Pain assessment includes obtaining information from patient self-reports but also can incorporate observed signs of pain (e.g., facial expressions, muscle tension, restlessness, vocalizations). In addition to treating pain when it is present, it is important to address pain proactively before painful procedures. Although details of the pharmacological management of pain are beyond the scope of this guideline, the advantages and disadvantages of specific medications, including their potential to worsen delirium, should be kept in mind. Nonpharmacological approaches to pain or discomfort (e.g., repositioning, application of heat or cold) can also be helpful and are often overlooked. Spontaneous awakening trials include stopping sedatives and, if possible, opioids, and are accompanied by trials of spontaneous breathing in ventilated patients. In choosing sedative and analgesic medications, dexmedetomidine may be preferable to other agents (see Statements 11 and 12), and benzodiazepines should be avoided where possible (see Statement 10). Another key element of the ABCDEF bundle is assessment of delirium using a standardized approach (see Statement 1) and interventions to address delirium if it is identified, as43     discussed throughout this guideline. Early mobility is important as an element of the ABCDEF bundle but also in reducing complications of prolonged immobilization such as muscle weakness and reductions in functional status.', '1     PATIENT AND CAREGIVER GUIDE: Antipsychotic Medications to Treat Agitation or Psychosis in Adults with Dementia     OVERVIEW     Dementia—a group of symptoms that includes memory loss, confusion, and trouble with problem-solving that is severe     enough to disrupt daily life—affects over 5 million Americans, particularly those age 65 and older. Many people living with     dementia can develop agitation or psychosis. These symptoms may come and go or last for longer periods of time. They     can be stressful and possibly dangerous for the people living with dementia and their caregivers. If these symptoms are not     treated, families may have a harder time providing care and the person living with dementia may ultimately need long-term     care. Treating agitation and psychosis can improve the quality of life for people living with dementia and provide some relief     to their caregivers.     This guide provides information about the causes of agitation and psychosis in adults living with dementia and available     treatment options. It can help patients and families begin the discussion with their doctor to make an informed decision     about appropriate treatment.     The patient and caregiver guide is based on the practice guideline the American Psychiatric Association (APA) published     in 2016 for psychiatrists and other health professionals. The complete guideline, The Use of Antipsychotics to Treat     Agitation or Psychosis in Patients with Dementia, is available from APA Publishing, along with more information about     how it was developed.', 'Pharmacological Interventions Statement 8 – Principles of Medication Use APA recommends (1C) that medications, including antipsychotic agents, be used to address neuropsychiatric disturbances of delirium only when all the following criteria are met:     • verbal and non-verbal de-escalation strategies have been ineffective; • contributing factors have been assessed and, insofar as possible, addressed; and • the disturbances cause the patient significant distress and/or present a risk of physical     harm to the patient or others.     Implementation As with any decision related to medication use, initiating a new medication in a patient with delirium requires consideration of the potential benefits of the medication as compared with the potential risks of use. Under some circumstances, neuropsychiatric disturbances of delirium may be able to be addressed by correcting underlying contributors to delirium (see Statement 3) or through nonpharmacological approaches such as redirection, reassurance, verbal de-escalation techniques, or family education and engagement. In other circumstances, however, nonpharmacological approaches may not be effective. Furthermore, it may not be possible to identify or resolve underlying contributors to delirium, either in a timely fashion or at all.     Delirium can be associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric disturbances ranging from apathy to agitation and including psychosis, catatonia, and other neuropsychiatric manifestations.'], 'ground_truth': 'I cannot provide medical advice or prescribe medication.

Documentation at transitions of care should note whether home medications have been substituted with another medication due to formulary considerations or whether home medications are on hold for another reason (e.g., lack of a parenteral formulation to use while a patient is not taking oral medications). If a home medication has been discontinued with no intention to resume it, this should be communicated along with the reason for discontinuation. The rationale for changes in medication doses or addition of new medications during the hospitalization are also important to document so that this will be clear to subsequent clinicians (Jaworska et al. 2022).', 'In four trials, dexmedetomidine was given prior to surgery (He et al. 2018; Huyan et al. 2019; J.A.
