# psych-ai-assistant
Solves the challenge of accessing and utilizing extensive internal documentation for a multi-state outpatient psychiatric group. This project implements a HIPAA-compliant AI assistant, using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on AWS, to provide secure, citation-based answers from internal SOPs, policies, and documentation to streamline staff training and provide immediate support.
