The FDA    � 2020 American Society of Addiction Medicine    approvals for these medications have primarily been for ‘opioid dependence’ as defined in prior versions of the DSM, and not necessarily the definition contained in the current version of the manual, the DSM-5. DSM-5 combined opioid abuse and opioid dependence criteria from prior versions of the DSM and included them in the new definition of opioid use disorder. As a result, pharmacologic treatment may not be appropriate for all patients along the entire opioid use disorder continuum (i.e. for individuals with new onset, mild opioid use disorder). In a study comparing opioid dependence from DSM-4 and opioid use disorder from DSM-5, optimal concordance occurred when four or more DSM-5 criteria were endorsed (i.e., the DSM-5 threshold for moderate opioid use disorder).11     The medications discussed in this Practice Guideline all have evidence supporting their safety and efficacy. While other medications have been used off-label to treat opioid use disorder the Guideline Committee has not issued recommen- dations on the use of these medications, with some exceptions (clearly noted in the text). Cost efficacy was not a consider- ation in the development of this Practice Guideline.     Each medication will be discussed in detail in subse- quent sections:    1.', 'A patient’s past experiences with treat- ment for opioid use disorder should be considered as well. Of course, above all, evidence supporting the potential efficacy and safety of the various treatments is critically important.     For most patients with opioid use disorder, the use of medications (combined with psychosocial treatment) is supe- rior to psychosocial treatment on its own; this is true for agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist medications. Evidence suggests that both methadone and buprenorphine maintenance treatments are superior to withdrawal management alone and both significantly reduce illicit opioid use.15,36 Further, mor- tality is lower in patients on methadone or buprenorphine, as compared to those not undergoing treatment.9,43 Methadone and buprenorphine also lower the risk of acquiring or spread- ing HIV infection.44–46 In clinical studies, evidence favors buprenorphine, compared to no treatment, in decreasing heroin use and improving treatment retention.35,47 Evidence also supports the efficacy of extended-release injectable naltrexone versus placebo for prevention of relapse to opioid use disorder.48–50     Pharmacotherapy Options The medications covered in this Practice Guideline     include those that have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of opioid use disorder. (See Appendix III for an overview of the main pharmacotherapy options and Appendix IV for a summary of available formulations).', '.    �    18    Part 1: Contains guidelines on the evaluation of opioid use disorder    �  Part 2: Provides recommendations regarding treatment options      �  Part 3: Describes the management of opioid withdrawal    �    Parts 4–6: Provide guidelines on medications for treating       opioid use disorder  �    Part 7: Describes psychosocial treatment used in conjunc-       tion with medications  �    Parts 8–12: Provide guidelines for treating special pop-       ulations and circumstances  �    Part 13: Describes the use of naloxone in treating       opioid overdose     Included and Excluded Medications The medications covered in this guideline include the     following:    1.  Methadone (part 4)    2.    Buprenorphine (part 5)    3.    Naltrexone (part 6)    4.    Naloxone (part 13)    5.    Clonidine (part 3)    6.    Lofexidine (part 3)       Methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone, and naloxone all act directly upon opioid receptors, particularly the mu- subtype.', 'Evaluation of a patient with opioid use disorder should include a detailed history of other past and current substance use and substance use disorders.      9.  The use of cannabis, stimulants, alcohol, and/or other addictive drugs should not be a reason to withhold or suspend opioid use disorder treat- ment. However, patients who are actively using substan- ces during opioid use disorder treatment may require greater support including a more intensive level of care (see The ASAM Criteria and The ASAM Standards).2,13      10.  The use of benzodiazepines and other sedative-hypnotics should not be a reason to with- hold or suspend treatment with methadone or      buprenorphine. While the combined use of these medi- cations increases the risk of serious side effects, the harm caused by untreated opioid use disorder can outweigh these risks. A risk-benefit analysis should be conducted, and greater support should be provided including careful medication management to reduce risks.14    11.  A nicotine use query should be completed routinely for all patients and counseling on cessation of the use of tobacco products and electronic nicotine delivery devices (e.g. vaping) provided if indicated.      12.', '• Withdrawal     Mental Health Status • (See Co-Occurring     Psychiatric Disorders)     Laboratory • CBC, LFTs, HIV,     hepatitis A, B & C • Urine drug testing (frequently) • STDs(?) • Pregnancy(?)

The FDA    � 2020 American Society of Addiction Medicine    approvals for these medications have primarily been for ‘opioid dependence’ as defined in prior versions of the DSM, and not necessarily the definition contained in the current version of the manual, the DSM-5. DSM-5 combined opioid abuse and opioid dependence criteria from prior versions of the DSM and included them in the new definition of opioid use disorder. As a result, pharmacologic treatment may not be appropriate for all patients along the entire opioid use disorder continuum (i.e. for individuals with new onset, mild opioid use disorder). In a study comparing opioid dependence from DSM-4 and opioid use disorder from DSM-5, optimal concordance occurred when four or more DSM-5 criteria were endorsed (i.e., the DSM-5 threshold for moderate opioid use disorder).11     The medications discussed in this Practice Guideline all have evidence supporting their safety and efficacy. While other medications have been used off-label to treat opioid use disorder the Guideline Committee has not issued recommen- dations on the use of these medications, with some exceptions (clearly noted in the text). Cost efficacy was not a consider- ation in the development of this Practice Guideline.     Each medication will be discussed in detail in subse- quent sections:    1.'\n",
       " 'A patient’s past experiences with treat- ment for opioid use disorder should be considered as well. Of course, above all, evidence supporting the potential efficacy and safety of the various treatments is critically important.     For most patients with opioid use disorder, the use of medications (combined with psychosocial treatment) is supe- rior to psychosocial treatment on its own; this is true for agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist medications. Evidence suggests that both methadone and buprenorphine maintenance treatments are superior to withdrawal management alone and both significantly reduce illicit opioid use.15,36 Further, mor- tality is lower in patients on methadone or buprenorphine, as compared to those not undergoing treatment.9,43 Methadone and buprenorphine also lower the risk of acquiring or spread- ing HIV infection.44–46 In clinical studies, evidence favors buprenorphine, compared to no treatment, in decreasing heroin use and improving treatment retention.35,47 Evidence also supports the efficacy of extended-release injectable naltrexone versus placebo for prevention of relapse to opioid use disorder.48–50     Pharmacotherapy Options The medications covered in this Practice Guideline     include those that have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of opioid use disorder.

However, patients who are actively using substan- ces during opioid use disorder treatment may require greater support including a more intensive level of care (see The ASAM Criteria and The ASAM Standards).2,13      10.  The use of benzodiazepines and other sedative-hypnotics should not be a reason to with- hold or suspend treatment with methadone or      buprenorphine. While the combined use of these medi- cations increases the risk of serious side effects, the harm caused by untreated opioid use disorder can outweigh these risks.

Diagnosis of this disorder is based on a checklist of symptoms defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) developed by the American Psychiatric Association.5     ASAM defines addiction as ‘‘a treatable, chronic medi- cal disease involving complex interactions among brain cir- cuits, genetics, the environment, and an individual’s life experiences. People with addiction use substances or engage in behaviors that become compulsive and often continue despite harmful consequences.’’ Addiction is a serious biopsy- chosocial illness, meaning that biological, psychological, and social factors can all contribute to both the development of, and recovery from, this disease. The ASAM Criteria (dis- cussed in Part 1) provide a framework for assessing how diverse biopsychosocial factors contribute to an individual patient’s addiction and the type and intensity of treatment needed to support their recovery. ASAM views addiction as fundamentally a neurological disease involving brain reward, motivation, memory, and related circuitry, and recognizes that there are unifying features in all cases of addiction, including substance-related addiction and nonsubstance-related addic- tion. In this context, the preferred term by ASAM for this disorder is addiction involving opioid use.'\n",
       " 'These behaviors may involve, but are not necessarily limited to substance use, gambling, video gaming, or compulsive sexual behaviors.1     Use of FDA approved medications for the treatment of substance use disorder is consistent with abstinence.     Abuse: This term is not recommended for use in clinical or research contexts. Harmful use of a specific psychoactive substance. When used to mean substance abuse, this term previously applied to one category of psychoactive substance- related disorders in the DSM. While recognizing that the term abuse is part of past diagnostic terminology, ASAM recom- mends that an alternative term be found for this purpose because of the pejorative connotations of the word abuse.     Addiction: Addiction is a treatable, chronic medical dis- ease involving complex interactions among brain circuits, genet- ics, the environment, and an individual’s life experiences. People with addiction use substances or engage in behaviors that become compulsive and often continue despite harmful consequences. Prevention efforts and treatment approaches for addiction are generally as successful as those for other chronic diseases.     Addiction specialist clinician: A health professional involved in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of addic- tion, such as a physician, psychologist, nurse practitioners (NPs), physician assistants (PA), clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse mid- wives (as distinguished from one specializing in research).'\n",

However, given the widespread North American application of the DSM’s categorization of disorders, this Practice Guideline will, for the sake of brevity and convention, use the term opioid use disorder.'\n",
       " 'Psychosocial interventions: Nonpharmacological interventions that may include structured, professionally administered interventions (e.g., cognitive behavior therapy or insight-oriented psychotherapy) or nonprofessional inter- ventions (e.g., self-help groups and non-pharmacological interventions from traditional healers).     Psychosocial treatment: Any nonpharmacological. pro- fessionally administered interventions (e.g., cognitive behavior therapy or insight-oriented psychotherapy) carried out in a therapeutic context at an individual, family, or group level.     Precipitated withdrawal: A condition that occurs when an opioid agonist is displaced from the opioid receptors by an antagonist in an opioid dependent individual. It is also possible for a partial agonist to precipitate withdrawal.     Recovery: A process of sustained action that addresses the biological, psychological, social, and spiritual disturbances inherent in addiction. This effort is in the direction of a consistent pursuit of abstinence, addressing impairment in behavioral control, dealing with cravings, recognizing problems in one’s behaviors and interpersonal relationships, and dealing more effectively with emotional responses. Recovery actions lead to reversal of negative, self-defeating internal processes and behav- iors, allowing healing of relationships with self and others. The concepts of humility, acceptance, and surrender are useful in this process. (Note: ASAM continues to explore, as an evolving process, improved ways to define recovery.)

More research is needed on how to improve access and linkage to psychiatric care for patients with co-occurring opioid use disorder.       PART 12: SPECIAL POPULATIONS: INDIVIDUALS IN THE     CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM     Background A substantial proportion of justice involved individuals     – including those in prisons, jails, drug courts, or under community supervision – have opioid use disorder. A history of incarceration is common among people who inject drugs; 56–90% of people who inject drugs have been incarcerated previously.181 The United States leads the world in the number of people incarcerated in Federal and state correctional    facilities.'\n",
       " 'Individuals entering the criminal justice system should not be subject to forced opioid withdrawal nor forced to transition from agonist (methadone or buprenorphine) to antagonist (naltrexone) treatment. If opioid withdrawal does occur, the patient should be provided withdrawal management services. Patients being treated for opioid use disorder at the time of entrance into the criminal justice system should continue their treatment. Criminal justice staff should coor- dinate care and access to pharmacotherapy to avoid interrup- tion in treatment.     Risk for relapse and overdose is particularly high in the weeks immediately following release from prison and jails. Patients being treated for opioid use disorder while in prison or jail should be stabilized on pharmacotherapy and continued on treatment after their release. Continuation of treatment after release results in a substantial reduction in all-cause and overdose mortality. Incarcerated individuals with a history of opioid use disorder who are not receiving pharmacological treatment should be assessed for relapse risk prior to reentry.'\n",
       " 'For the purposes of this Practice Guideline, a prison is to be differentiated from a jail. At the most basic level, the fundamental difference between jail and prison is the length of stay for inmates. Jails are usually run by local law enforce- ment and/or local government agencies and designed to hold inmates awaiting trial or serving a short sentence. Prison terms are of longer duration. Opioid use disorder treatment should not be discontinued when individuals become incarcerated.     Federal law requires that incarcerated individuals be treated for health problems since they have no other way to access medical care. Thus, individuals with hypertension, COPD, diabetes, HIV, wound infections, schizophrenia, and other serious health problems receive treatment while incar- cerated. Addiction treatment, with few exceptions, has his- torically been excluded from the range of services provided in U.S. correctional facilities. However, as addiction is increas- ingly recognized as a serious health problem for which there are effective medications, there is growing pressure for jails and prisons to treat this disease, as is required for other health conditions.     Effectiveness of Pharmacotherapy Pharmacotherapy can effectively treat opioid use disor-     der among incarcerated individuals. All FDA approved med- ications for the treatment of opioid use disorder should be available to patients within the criminal justice system. The treatment plan, including choice of medication, should be based on the patient’s individual clinical needs.'\n",
       " 'Individuals in the criminal justice system who have opioid use disorder or who are experienc- ing opioid withdrawal should be offered a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial treatment (based on an assessment of their individual psychosocial needs). A patient’s decision to decline psychosocial treatment or the absence of available psychosocial treatment should not preclude or delay pharmacological treatment of opioid use disorder, with appropriate medication management. Motivational interviewing or enhancement can be used to encourage patients to engage in psychosocial treatment services appropriate for addressing their individual needs.      6.  If an OTP is not accessible, providers may need to transition individuals from methadone to buprenorphine. Effectively transitioning from methadone to buprenor- phine can be challenging but can be achieved safely if managed by a provider experienced in the procedure.      7.  Risk for relapse and overdose is particularly high in the weeks immediately following release from prison and jails. Patients being treated for opioid use disorder while in prison or jail should be stabilized on pharmacotherapy (methadone, buprenor- phine or naltrexone) and continue in treatment after their release.

The FDA-approved autoinjector was designed to be used by a patient or family member for the treatment of opioid overdose. In November 2015 the U.S. FDA-approved the intranasal formulation.     Few studies have compared the efficacy of naloxone by route of administration, including intranasal, IM, or intrave- nous. Before FDA approval of the naloxone nasal spray product, many first responders used improvised adaptors to convert the liquid naloxone product into a rapidly acting nasal spray. A recent study comparing the FDA approved nasal spray and autoinjector to the improvised nasal devices found that the approved formulations were superior to the impro- vised devices delivering higher levels of naloxone into the blood stream.211 Further research is needed to definitively assess the relative effectiveness of injectable vs. intranasal naloxone.

Each member of the Guideline Com- mittee reviewed the guideline analysis and literature review, and privately rated 245 hypothetical clinical statements on a 9- point scale of appropriateness. In the context of this Practice Guideline, the meaning of appropriateness was defined as:     A statement, procedure or treatment is considered to be appropriate if the expected health benefit (e.g., increased life expectancy, relief of pain, reduction in anxiety, improved functional capacity) exceeds the expected nega- tive consequences (e.g., mortality, morbidity, anxiety, pain) by a sufficiently wide margin that the procedure is worth doing, exclusive of cost.    20    An appropriateness score of 1 meant that the statement was highly inappropriate.

Intended Audience This Practice Guideline is primarily intended for clini-     cians involved in evaluating patients and providing authori- zation for pharmacological treatments at any level. The intended audience falls into the broad groups of physicians; other healthcare providers (especially those with prescribing authority); medical educators and faculty for other healthcare professionals in training; and clinical care managers, includ- ing those offering utilization management services.     Qualifying Statement This ASAM Practice Guideline is intended to aid     clinicians in their clinical decision-making and patient man- agement. The Practice Guideline strives to identify and define clinical decision-making junctures that meet the needs of most patients in most circumstances. Clinical decision-making should involve consideration of the quality and availability of expertise and services in the community wherein care is provided. The recommendations in this guideline reflect the consensus of an independent committee (see Methodology Section) convened by ASAM between September 2018 and November 2019, to oversee a focused update of this Practice Guideline. This Practice Guideline will be updated regularly as clinical and scientific knowledge advances.    8    Prescribed courses of treatment described in this Prac- tice Guideline are effective only if the recommendations, as outlined, are followed.'\n",

Areas for Further Research  1.    Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of       specific types of psychosocial treatment in combination with methadone in OTP or inpatient settings. Treatment with methadone generally includes some psychosocial components, however, it is unclear when added psychoso- cial treatment improves patient outcomes, and which psychosocial treatments are beneficial to which patients.    2.  Research is needed to evaluate the use of ECG in treatment with methadone in preventing adverse cardiac events.      3.  Further research is needed on how to determine the opti- mal length of treatment with methadone for individual patients.      4.  More research is needed on outcomes following transitions from methadone to other opioid use disorder treatment medications. For example, to what extent do different protocols for medication transitions affect short- and long-term treatment outcomes.'\n",

Overview of Methodology This Practice Guideline was developed using the     RAND Corporation (RAND)/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Appropriateness Method (RAM) a process that combines scientific evidence and clinical knowledge to determine the appropriateness of a set of clinical proce- dures.12 The RAM is a deliberate approach encompassing review of existing guidelines, literature reviews, appropriate- ness ratings, necessity reviews, and document development. For this project, ASAM selected an independent committee to oversee guideline development, to participate in review of treatment scenarios, and to assist in writing. For the 2015 guideline development process, ASAM’s then Quality Improvement Council, chaired by Margaret Jarvis, MD, over- saw the selection process for the independent development committee, referred to as the Guideline Committee.7     The 2015 Guideline Committee was comprised of 11 experts and researchers from multiple disciplines, medical specialties, and subspecialties, including academic research, internal medicine, family medicine, addiction medicine, addiction psychiatry, general psychiatry, obstetrics/gynecol- ogy, pharmacology, and clinical neurobiology. Physicians with both allopathic and osteopathic training were represented in the Guideline Committee.'\n",

Clinicians should consider the patient’s preferences, past treatment history, current state of ill- ness, and treatment setting when deciding between the use of methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone.    2.  There is no recommended time limit for pharmacological treatment.      3.  Patients’ psychosocial needs should be assessed, and patients should be offered or referred to psychosocial treatment based on their indi- vidual needs. However, a patient’s decision to decline psychosocial treatment or the absence of available      psychosocial treatment should not preclude or delay phar- macotherapy, with appropriate medication management. Motivational interviewing or enhancement can be used to encourage patients to engage in psychosocial treatment services appropriate for addressing individual needs.    4.  The venue in which treatment is provided should be carefully considered. Methadone can only be provided in opioid treatment programs (OTPs) and acute care settings (under limited circumstances).'\n",
       " 'When data are lacking from RCTs, other methods must be used to help clinicians make the best choices. In addition, these guidelines are unique in that they include all three of the medications approved at present by the FDA in multiple formulations, and they address the needs of special populations such as pregnant women, individuals with pain, adolescents, individuals with co-occur- ring psychiatric disorder, and individuals in the criminal justice system. Such special populations are often excluded from RCTs, making the use of RCT data even more difficult. The RAM process combines the best available scientific evidence combined with the collective judgment of experts to yield statements about the appropriateness of specific procedures that clinicians can apply to their everyday practice.     ASAM’s Quality Improvement Council (QIC) was the oversight committee for guideline development. The QIC appointed a Guideline Committee to participate throughout the development process, rate treatment scenarios, and assist in writing. In selecting the committee members, the QIC made every effort to avoid actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of relationships with industry    � 2020 American Society of Addiction Medicine    and other entities among members of the Guideline Commit- tee.

Adolescents have reported that they are less likely to seek substance use disorder treatment if services are not confidential.161 Confidential care, particularly with respect to sensitive issues such as reproduc- tive health and substance use, has become a well-established practice.162,163 This is a subject of complexity as it is an area governed by both Federal and state laws. Moreover, defined age ranges of adolescence vary. A myriad of clinical and legal responsibilities may be evoked if confronted by a young person’s request for confidentiality. More than half of the states in the U.S., by law, permit adolescents under 18 years of age to consent to substance use disorder treatment without parental consent. Collaboration with families, including shared information and decision making, should be pursued with the adolescent’s consent. Providers will also sometimes need to make decisions based on best medical judgement about disclosure without adolescent consent for safety con- cerns to address imminent danger. State law should also be consulted.'\n",

Assessment of Psychiatric Co-occurrence The assessment of psychiatric disorders is critical when     attempting to place patients in the appropriate treatment. Hospitalization may be appropriate for patients with severe or unstable psychiatric symptoms that may compromise the safety of self or others. An initial patient assessment should determine whether the patient is stable. Patients with suicidal or homicidal ideation should be referred immediately for treatment and possibly hospitalization. Patients should also be assessed for signs or symptoms of acute psychosis and chronic psychiatric disorders.     An assessment including medical history, physical examination, and an assessment of mental health status and/or psychiatric disorder should occur at the beginning of agonist or antagonist treatment (see Part 1: Assessment and Diagnosis of Opioid Use Disorder). However, completion of all assessments should not delay or preclude initiating pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder. If not completed before initiating treatment, assessments should be completed    � 2020 American Society of Addiction Medicine� Adopted by the ASAM Board of Directors December 18, 2019 NPG for the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder    as soon as possible thereafter. Reassessment using a detailed mental status examination should occur after stabilization with methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone.'\n",

Patients who are identified as exhibiting urgent or emergent psychiatric conditions, or who are psychiatrically unstable and represent a danger to themselves or others, should be referred to the appropriate level of care for their safety and the safety of others.
